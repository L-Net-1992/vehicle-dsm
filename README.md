## Dependencies

*vehicledsm* is a GStreamer plugin written in C/C++.
For compiling the project, the following tools are *required*:
* libtool
* autoconf
* libgstreamer1.0-dev
* libtesseract-dev
* libleptonica-dev
* gcc 5.5 (**or lower**)


## Dataset

Part 1 (subset 1,2a): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xXgMhjpMUT-S7_-3BGwfiD4G2MvR9tKO)

Part 2 (subset 2b): [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wCEzHvO8D_bbxqxbr8U2KlK0VZZwW58P)

<!--### About the subdir training-->
<!--The training data for the SVM model is not going to be released.-->
<!--Enter in 'training/icdar' and run the script 'run.sh'.-->


## Build and run

Once all dependencies are correctly installed, configure the package and build
it with:
```
  cd gst-plugin
  ./autogen.sh
  make
```

If everything goes fine, the binary file `libgstplugin.so` must appear in
`gst-plugin/gstreamer/.libs`.

To inspect that file (check if it is working properly), do:
```
  cd gst-plugin/tools/
  ./inspect.sh
```
It should list the properties of the `vehicledsm` plugin.

To run the software with the provided videos (please download the dataset
first if not already done), do:
```
  cd gst-plugin/tools
  ./run-dsm.sh ../../dataset/set1/
```

### Some tips about GStreamer

Modify gst-plugin/src/Makefile.am to add or remove source files to build or
add additional dependencies or compiler flags or change the name of the
plugin file to be installed. Run ./autoregen.sh if changes don't take effect
automatically on 'make'.

Modify gst-plugin/configure.ac to check for additional library dependencies
or other features needed by your plugin. Run ./autoregen.sh if changes don't
take effect automatically on 'make'.

Once the plugin is built you can either install it with 'sudo make install'
(however, this will by default go into the /usr/local prefix where it won't
be picked up by a GStreamer installed from packages, so you would need to
set the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to include or point to
/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/ for your plugin to be found by a from-package
GStreamer). Alternatively, you will find your plugin binary in
gst-plugins/src/.libs/ as libgstplugin.so or similar (the extension may vary),
so you can also set the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environmen variable to the
gst-plugins/src/.libs/ directory (best to specify an absolute path though).


## Known issues

* For some unknown reason, sometimes the software crashes with a `SIGSEGV`
  just after launched.
